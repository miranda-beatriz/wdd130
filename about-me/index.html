   <h2> Bia </h2>
   <p> Hi, my name it´s Beatriz but everyone calls me Bia I´m 22 years old and I´m from São Paulo, Brazil.
     I served on the mission Curitiba South Brazil and I returned make almost two years.</p>
    <p>I love listening to music, dancing, reading books, and watching TV shows in my free time. I also love learning and am very excited to learn more about programming and how to create sites with this course.</p> 
    <p>My favorite scripture is Doctrine and Covenants 123:17 which says “Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, let us cheerfully do all things that lie in our power; and then may we stand still, with the utmost assurance, to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed.” I love this scripture because helps me to keep hope even when things go all wrong.</p>
    <p>I love my Savior and I know that He will help us with our wish to pursue more knowledge.</p>
    <p>Hope we gonna have a good semester together! </p>
